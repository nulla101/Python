Code Explanation
  The send_email() function retrieves user data from the Excel file, creates a NewsFeed object for each user, 
  and composes an email with the user's name, interest, and news feed. The email is then sent using the Yagmail library.
  
  The while loop runs continuously, checking the current time every 60 seconds (1 minute). If it's 10:30 AM, 
  the send_email() function is called to send news feeds to all users.
  
  The NewsFeed class uses the News API to retrieve news articles related to the user's interest. 
  It constructs the API URL, retrieves the JSON response, extracts the article titles and URLs, and formats them into a single string for the email body.
